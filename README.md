# Introduction

This repository contains a Web site made as a final project for the React-Js course, of the "Full Stack Web Developer" career taught at the [Coderhouse] academy (https://www.coderhouse.com/), in Argentina.

## The Project

## [Skate Planet](LINK DE LA PAGINA)
### History..

This page is an imitation of an e-commerce of the company dedicated to skateboarding "Deathwish". The idea arose from the creator's passion for this sport.

## Project Progress

Now with some work done previously with the acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we began to know the functionalities and facilities that React presents like...

* ##### Componentes
* ##### Hooks
* ##### Context's

## Dependencies

* ##### bootstrap v5.1.1
* ##### firebase v8.10.0
* ##### react-icons v4.3.1
* ##### react-router-dom v5.3.0
* ##### sweetalert2 v11.1.9

#### Component

```html

export const Component = () => {

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>This is a Classic Component!</h1>
        </div>
    )
}

```


We used NPM to install the dependencies i mencioned before with some code like this:

`$ npm install sweetalert2 `


## Finally, Firebase!

After having simulated our e-commerce locally, we have taken it to the virtual server that Google provides us, Firebase.
 With this last step we are ready to get and bring information dynamically generated on our websites and thus be able to execute perfectly controlled purchase orders to be able to launch an e-commerce and thus also open the way for the next destination: Backend Development!
